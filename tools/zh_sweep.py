"""Place vendored Zero Hour code in BFME retail .text by masked-byte search.

BFME 1 and Generals: Zero Hour are both SAGE/W3D games built with the same
compiler, so a ZH translation unit frequently emits function bodies that are
byte-identical to BFME's. This sweep compiles the vendored tree, carves each
function COMDAT out of the objects, blanks every relocation slot -- those four
bytes hold link-time addresses two different executables cannot be expected to
agree on -- and searches .text for a placement of what is left.

  compile     build ZH translation units into the sweep object cache
  match       carve and place every COMDAT          -> build/zh_sweep/match.json
  land        append ledger rows for placements that survive filtering
  land-multi  supersede gen-dump rows with the exact-MULTI placements
  packets     write conversion work packets for near misses at unclaimed addresses

A placement is evidence of identical CODE, which is not the same as evidence of
identity: `land` drops every placement that overlaps ground another row already
claims, that carries a compiler-local label instead of a name, or whose name the
ledger already spends at another address. Search is uncapped on purpose -- a
capped needle scan can miss the second placement of a body and report an
ambiguous match as a unique one.
