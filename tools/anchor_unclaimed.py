"""Identify unclaimed retail functions by the string literals only they reference.

next_work.py's Ghidra tier already does string anchoring, but it starts from a
drift row -- so it can only ever name a function that already has a Zero Hour
counterpart in drift_report.csv. That input is finite and now drained: at
db3e7b522 the structural tier holds 2 candidates and the Ghidra tier 0.

This runs the same evidence the other way round. Start from every unclaimed
function in the image, take the literals that no *other* unclaimed function
references, and look those up in the Zero Hour reference tree. Measured at
db3e7b522:

    19,464  unclaimed functions >=32B
     1,326  have at least one uniquely-referenced literal
       138  whose literals appear in exactly one ZH source file   <- emitted
        59  ambiguous across several ZH files                     <- emitted, medium
     1,129  literal absent from the ZH tree entirely (BFME-only code)

The 1,129 are not served here. They carry a real lead -- a distinctive string, a
boundary, resolved callees -- but naming them means synthesising an identity
rather than recovering one, which is a different job with a different review bar.

`zh_source` is a path relative to the Zero Hour tree. It is deliberately not a
basename: 5,491 reference files share only 2,735 basenames, so a basename cannot
say where a literal lives and two unrelated files of the same name would read as
one source and score "high". See zh_literal_index.

A row here is a lead, never an identity: the anchor proves only that some
unclaimed function references a literal the reference also contains. Confirm the
named function against the disassembly before spending its name.

Scanning 5,512 reference files takes far longer than next_work.py's ten-second
budget, so the result is cached in reverse/anchored_candidates.csv the way
drift_report.csv is. Regenerate after a batch of landings -- the cached file is a
snapshot of what was unclaimed when it was written, so addresses landed since
then stay in it until the next run.
