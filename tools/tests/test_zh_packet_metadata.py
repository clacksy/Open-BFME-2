"""What a Zero Hour work packet is allowed to assert about its own address.

A packet's address and size are not observations, they are the sweep's guess:
the address is wherever a masked needle aligned, and the size is the length of
the Zero Hour body, not of the retail one. Both were printed as fact. A
contributor who trusts them writes a ledger row at an address the function does
not start at, or for an extent it does not have, and the row byte-matches
anyway -- build.py copies DIR32 relocation bytes out of retail rather than
proving them -- so the gate cannot catch what the packet manufactured.

Every path here runs over a synthetic image and a scratch ledger under tmp_path.
The real packet directory is derived and rewritten wholesale, so a test that
pointed at it would delete the live queue.
